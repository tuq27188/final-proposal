# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Calorie Burn Calculator 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Calculator that calculates how many calories you burned 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My software will allow the user to calculate the amount of calories burned based on user input. The program will request the weight, intensity, distance(if you are tracking walking, running, or cycling), duration if you're tracking an activity like sports. The program can save the data and be imported as a csv as well as be exported into the program. The program can also give the average of calories burned based on the previous data. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The basic functions of the calculator being able to calculate, being able to import and export the data, and to calculate the average. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Adding additional features such as how many more calories need to be burned to reach the average amount of calories burned 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

All the features listed previously but also an interface that users can interact with.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

What I need to research is how to incorporate everyhting together to form one coherent program, If I am able to I would need to research how to create a user interface that correlates with the program. I would also like to research more on how to integrate importing and exporting data to optimize my code and make it not look messy.
